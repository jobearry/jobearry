# Raszpberry

Hi! I go by the name "Rasz" and I am from the Philippines.

I am interested in designing the web and designs in general, I also enjoy programming.
Currently, I work as a Junior Programmer in a manufacturing company where I have tasks
related to automation and web development.
I currently use C# for the majority of my projects, but right now I am learning TypeScript for Angular

Will be adding more projects here soon.
<br> Cheers! :beer:
