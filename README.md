Hi!  
I am from the Philippines!  Currently, I work as a Junior Programmer in a manufacturing company   
where I have tasks related to automation and web development.  
I use C#, and Angular for the majority of my projects.

In addition, I am also learning React, and TailwindCSS through Frontend Mentor Challenges.  
I am also planning to learn NextJS after I fully grasped the basics with React.

Will be adding more projects here soon.  
Cheers! :beer:
